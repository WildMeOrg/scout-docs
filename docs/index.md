# Scout Docs

Wild Me's Scout is designed to support processing aerial survey data taken from planes. Current machine learning is focused on supporting terrestrial surveys.

With Scout, you can:

* Ingest high volumes of .ARW and .JPG images collected from survey cameras
* Group images as “Tasks” that can be assigned to other users (e.g., image annotators) or machine learning (ML) models for bounding box creation and species labeling
* Review and ground truth annotated images for accuracy
* Draw division lines for overlapping image sequences with annotations
* Export .CSV data files for statistical analysis

## Where Should I Start?

* Are you planning on setting up Scout on your computer and managing the system, including system updates? You should start with the [System Administrator](system-administrators/index.md) section.
* Are you going to manage image upload, user accounts, and data management? Do you have the final say in annotation state? You should start with [Lab Lead](lab-lead/index.md) section.
* Are you going to be reviewing images and editing annotations? You should start with the [Annotators](all-users/index.md) section.
