## Why am I seeing an error message when I upload my images?

Images that have been transferred across communication tools (Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.) undergo processing that causes them to fail. We recommend transferring images using a dedicated file-sharing system (Dropbox, etc.) or you can ZIP the images before sharing them through communication tools. These methods preserve the AIQ (Apparent Image Quality) needed for pixel-level zooming in that may be required to find your animals.

## How can I verify that all of my images were uploaded?

Create a task with all of your images and then export them using the following steps:

1. Create a task that contains all of the images you've uploaded
2. Filter the task list to to your newly created task
3. Select the Image export option
4. Review your export

## I need to use custom labels that aren't in my model. What should I call them?

When leveraging custom classification labels for data that will be used for new model training, consider matching the classification labels to the [taxonomy mapping from lila.science](https://lila.science/taxonomy-mapping-for-camera-trap-data-sets/). This allows for greater consistency in machine learning in the conservation space.
