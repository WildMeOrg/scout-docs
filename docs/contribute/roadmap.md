# Roadmap
The roadmaps below are rough outlines of our objectives. We operate by milestones, and sometimes things change dramatically because of technical limitations or pressing issues reported by users. Because Scout started as a tool to support a single project, We are working to broaden the usage by making it a more generalized tool. We want to improve the workflow management and annotation interface.

## 2.5.0
- Point annotations
- Clean up annotation interface 
- Task review that doesn't set ground truth
- New filter: random subset of images

## 2.6.0
- Automated overlap detection
- Grouping of tasks into projects
- Annotator time spent
- Annotator performance export

## General Goals
We have general objectives that we need to address eventually, but have no specific timeframe. If you're interested in working on something in this list, let us know!
- Video tracking
- Visualization of survey track
- Visualization of static locations over time (ex. change in tree health)
- Performance improvements are always welcome
- Text localization
- Simplify docker install
- `dmg` or `exe` installation available for additional OS support
